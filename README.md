# MultiDimMotifDiscovery
**Approximate discovery of multidimensional motifs in time series**. 

The `EvaluationSuite` Jupiter Notebook offer an interactive small evaluation against the SoTA for exact discovery other than many usage examples without the need to download anything. For further evaluation refer to `source/test.py` \
The `Thesis_Plots` notebook ensures repeatability for all the figures included in the thesis. 


`Discretized Random Projections` has been implemented with the use of *tensoring* to minimize the computations.
